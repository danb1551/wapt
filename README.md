#### APT
###### But on Windows
###### So I name it
# WAPT

! somethink like that alredy exist and it's named bucket or somethink like that soooo I stop this project !

Did you ever think about apt on windows like in Linux? Yes, I did, and that’s why I started writing this code.

It's not alredy for use but you can look at it.

Web: [It's here (Just click)](https://wapt.pythonanywhere.com)

### How to make your own package?

Type
```bash
wapt deploy [folder]
```


In your folder must be main.exe file. That's everything. But if your application requires more thing to run, everything in the folder will be uploaded (Max. folder size is 512MB).
<!--
If you want to ignore some folders in root folder of you projekt, just type
```bash
wapt [folder] --ignore [folder-1, folder-2, ..., folder-n]
```

přidat spouštění aplikace po zadání příkazu
```bash
wapt [package-name]
```
výchozí bude 64bit

přidat tutoriál na deploying aplikací

```bash
./wapt
